# Hydraulic Actuator Data Set

Hydraulic actuators are used across the shipping industry and are installed in various environments performing a wide array of operations.  Their widespread use necessitates a condition-based maintenance program, ideally utilizing machine learning models to provide real-time estimates of the health condition, to maintain an acceptable level of fleet readiness.  This repository contains a hydraulic actuator dataset collected from six industrial actuators under various fault conditions and loads.  This repository also contains code for running a variety of baseline experiments on the data set.
